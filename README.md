# closure-loop
understanding the concept of closures in a for loop

The problem statement is to alert the number of the div that is clicked

This project can be implemented in two ways
1. With DOM manipulation, where while attaching the event for click we explicitly add a id with the index and this can be passed to the function being called
2. Without the DOM manipulation, pass the index to the function and the attach event. Here we pass the index and alert the same by incrementing it by 1
